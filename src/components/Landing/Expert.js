          Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects each individual uniquely,
          requiring personalized care. Early intervention can reduce lifetime
          costs by up to two-thirds, but gathering complete data from parents
          remains a challenge. CaptureEase Technologies simplifies this process.
          Parents can easily log data via text or voice, which is combined with
          video and biometric inputs to give behavior analysts a full view of
          the childâ€™s progress. This modular system reduces the burden on
          parents while improving treatment outcomes and lowering costs.
